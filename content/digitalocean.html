<h1>&gt; Tribblix on Digital Ocean</h1>

<p>
Digital Ocean is one place to run Tribblix in the
<a href="cloud.html">cloud.</a>
</p>

<p>
On Digital Ocean, you will have to upload a custom image. Don't worry, the
images have already been created, but you will have to upload them yourself.
(There doesn't appear to be a way to share custom images.)
</p>

<p>
In the left hand pane on the console, select 'Backups & Snapshots',
and then the Custom Images tab. Then click the "Import via URL" button
(it may appear as if it's greyed out, but it is clickable).
</p>

<p>
The currently valid URLs for images are, for vanilla Tribblix and OmniTribblix
respectively:
</p>
<ul>
<li>http://iso.tribblix.org/iso/tribblix-m37.img.gz</li>
<li>http://iso.tribblix.org/iso/omnitribblix-m37lx.img.gz</li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon clicking Next, you'll get a screen to enter an image name, a distribution
(you'll have to choose Unknown), and a region for where you want to upload
the image to. Then upload.
</p>

<p>
It will take a little while, but after a few minutes the image will be
available. Then, under the "More" dropdown to the right of the image name,
you can Start a droplet. You can then select the normal droplet attributes
such as droplet size, and an ssh key that will allow you to ssh in
directly as root.
</p>

<p>
With the m28 and later releases, you can attach an additional volume. (This
requires the vioscsi driver, which is why it wasn't available in prior
releases.)
</p>

<p>
You may find that a reboot doesn't work - the guest becomes inaccessible.
A power cycle from the control panel ought to fix that. This is being tracked
as illumos issue <a href="https://www.illumos.org/issues/14526">14526</a>.
