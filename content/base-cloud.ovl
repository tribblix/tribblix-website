<h1>Overlay base-cloud - Base packages, for cloud/virtual</h1>
<p>This is the set of packages that live in the base cloud images. It provides
only the minimal set of drivers that cloud instances need to support.
It's designed just for that, and would normally
be extended to at least the @base overlay.</p>
