title: Using SSH
---
<h1>&gt; Using SSH</h1>

<p>To connect to a different system, you'll often end up using the SSH
protocol, either directly as <code>ssh</code> or with one of its variants
like <code>scp</code> or <code>sftp</code>.</p>

<p>One advantage of using <code>ssh</code> is that you can set it up so that
you don't need a password to log in, but instead you use a secret key. The
advantage here is that a secret key is much harder to guess than a password.</p>

<h2>ssh keys</h2>

<p>To create a secret key:</p>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "my new key" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</pre>
<p>Generally, you'll want to create and use a <code>ed25519</code> key.
If you have to connect to older legacy systems you might need to use
<code>rsa</code> - you can create keys of different types if you need to.</p>

<p>The <code>-C</code> flag adds a comment, which can be useful if you create
multiple keys, as you then have a reminder of what a key was for.</p>

<p>You can additionally protect a key with a passphrase, so that when you
use it you'll be prompted for the passphrase for greater security. The above
command will ask you what the passphrase should be.</p>

<p>If you don't want a passphrase, then you can use:</p>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "my new key" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""
</pre>

<p>To use the key, you need to put the public key (here it will be
<code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code>) into the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>
file on the system you need to connect to. Don't send the private key,
which is the <code>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> file. You may need to connect
to the remote system with a password first in order to transfer the key.</p>

<h2>connecting</h2>

<p>To connect to a system it's then as simple as:</p
<pre>
ssh other.host.name
</pre>

<p>The first time you connect you'll get a dialog saying the that the other
system isn't recognised. This looks like:</p>
<pre>
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.232 (192.168.1.232)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:/rg8IOuSz2Jk3oTx+COkFl7/EyBSW0WFd3BEDN+E65g.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
</pre>
<p>This is normal, if you're sure its's the right system (ideally you will
be given an indepependent way to confirm that the fingerprint is correct) then
accept. The identity will be saved and then checked every time you connect to
that system in future. If at a later time the key doesn't match, the ssh
connection will fail and you'll get a fairly bold message indicating that
something has gone wrong:</p>
<pre>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
</pre>
<p>There might be several reasons for this. One is that there's a security
problem and something's been compromised. An alternative is that the system's
key has been changed for a good reason, although you'll normally be told if
that's happened. In that case you can tell ssh to forget the old host key:</p>
<pre>
ssh -R  other.host.name
</pre>
<p>and then you'll be offered the chance to accept the new key.</p>

<h2>ssh and zones</h2>

<p>While you can connect to a zone using <code>pfexec zlogin</code>, it's
often more convenient to use ssh. That's fine, but you need to know the
zone's IP address, because the chances are that it's name might not be in
DNS.</p>

<p>On Tribblix, because this is a fairly common need, there's a
convenient helper command. Just use:</p>
<pre>
zap zssh my-zone
</pre>
<p>That assumes your account exists in the zone (you can share an account
with a zone using the <code>-U</code> flag to <code>zap create-zone</code>).
Or you can connect to a different account in the zone with:</p>
<pre>
zap zssh jill@my-zone
</pre>

<p>Another feature available with zones on Tribblix is that you can use the
<code>-k</code> flag to <code>zap create-zone</code> to
<a href="6.zones_bhyve.html">configure a zone</a> using cloud-init, allowing
you to log in via ssh as root (or the zone's default user, which might be
different).</p>

<h2>legacy systems</h2>

<p>Not all systems you connect to will be modern. Some will the using older
ssh versions, and over time there might not be a compatible set of configuration
properties. Fortunately it's possible to tell ssh to enable some of the older
features if you need to. The following are some of the know cases.</p>

<p>To connect to Solaris 10, you'll need:</p>
<pre>
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 ...
</pre>

<p>To connect to Solaris 11.2 (and some server SPs or ILOMs will need this):</p>
<pre>
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa ...
</pre>

<p>Note also that you'll often need to use an older key type, like rsa, to
connect to these legacy systems. You may need to also add:</p>
<pre>
ssh -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa ...
</pre>

<p>You can also add a section to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file if you
connect to a given host often, for example you might have something like the
following that will get applied every time you connect to that host:</p>
<pre>
Host myoldsparc.local
  PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
  HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
</pre>
