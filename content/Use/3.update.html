<h1>&gt; Keeping Up to Date</h1>

<p>Software is never static, and updated releases - whether to fix
  bugs, address security issues, or add features - appear in a
  seemingly never-ending stream.</p>

<p>Software in Tribblix is generally split into two parts - the
  underlying operating system (illumos), and the applications that you
  run on top of that. To update the underlying operating system, see
  the <a href="3.upgrade.html">next section</a>. To learn about
  application updates, read on.</p>

<p>All software updates and Tribblix upgrades need to be done as root.</p>

<p>The first part of the update process is to issue the following
  command:</p>
  
<code>
zap refresh
</code>

<p>This will not update any software, but will download newer versions
  of the software catalog. You can then see if any software updates
  are available:</p>

<code>
zap verify-overlay -a
</code>

<p>To update the components of one specific overlay to their current
  versions:</p>

<code>
zap update-overlay <em>overlay_name</em>
</code>

<p>To update the components of all installed overlays to their current
  versions:</p>

<code>
zap update-overlay -a
</code>
