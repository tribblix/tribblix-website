<h1>&gt; Managing Certificates</h1>

<p>The set of digital certificates used by most applications is installed
in the directory</p>
<pre>
/etc/openssl
</pre>
<p>The name <code>/etc/ssl</code> is also linked here.</p>

<p>The certificates are installed as a single bundle in the
<code>cacert.pem</code> file, and expanded as a set of files under
<code>/etc/openssl/certs</code>. These variations are to handle the
various different ways that applications expect to find certificates.</p>

<p>The actual set of certificates installed is
<a href="https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html">extracted</a> from
the Mozilla CA list.</p>

<p>If you need to add your own certificate to the list, updating both
the single file bundle and the expanded list, use:</p>
<pre>
zap manage-cacerts [subcommand ...]
</pre>

<p>To add a certificate in a given file:</p>
<pre>
zap manage-cacerts add /path/to/certificate.pem
</pre>

<p>To list all added certificates:</p>
<pre>
zap manage-cacerts list
</pre>

<p>To list all certificates, including the default certificates:</p>
<pre>
zap manage-cacerts listall
</pre>

<p>To remove a certificate that has previously been added:</p>
<pre>
zap manage-cacerts remove certificate-name
</pre>

<p>The name to remove can be obtained from the list subcommand.</p>
