<h1>&gt; Building Tribblix</h1>

<p>One of the key freedoms of free software is the freedom to study how
the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish
(freedom 1). While there's always a requirement for a non-trivial level
of skill, the intention of this chapter is to explain how you can
exercise this freedom in the context of Tribblix.</p>

<p>The first step in this is to understand the
<a href="9.building_1repos.html">list of source code repositories</a>
that are used to construct Tribblix.</p>

<p>The second step is to <a href="9.building_2illumos.html">build
illumos-gate</a> from source.</p>
