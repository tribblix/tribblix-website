<h1>&gt; Desktop Use</h1>

<p>Tribblix provides a variety of desktop environments and window
  managers, and you can choose which one to use. To use a desktop,
  you will need at least the x11 overlay to be installed, although
  adding the retro-desktop overlay will give more choice and enlarge
  the set of available utilities.</p>

<p>To select a desktop environment or window manager for use,
  the <code>setxsession</code> utility is provided. If run without
  arguments, it will list the known options and whether they're
  installed. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>afterstep: Afterstep (installed)</li>
<li>amiwm: Amiga-like Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>awesome: awesome window manager (installed)</li>
<li>awm: Ardent Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>cde: CDE (installed)</li>
<li>ctwm: CTWM (installed)</li>
<li>cwm: OpenBSD cwm Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>e19: Enlightenment (installed)</li>
<li>ede: EDE (installed)</li>
<li>emwm: Enhanced Motif Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>fluxbox: Fluxbox (installed)</li>
<li>fvwm: FVWM (installed)</li>
<li>i3wm: improved tiling wm (installed)</li>
<li>icewm: IceWM (installed)</li>
<li>leftwm: LeftWM (installed)</li>
<li>mate: MATE (installed)</li>
<li>mwm: Motif Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>olvwm: OLVWM (installed)</li>
<li>olwm: OLWM (installed)</li>
<li>openbox: Openbox (installed)</li>
<li>pekwm: PekWM (installed)</li>
<li>piewm: Window Manager with pie menus (installed)</li>
<li>qvwm: QVWM (installed)</li>
<li>tvtwm: Tom's virtual Tab Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>twm: TWM (installed)</li>
<li>uwm: UDE Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>vtwm: Virtual tab Window Manager (installed)</li>
<li>wmaker: Window Maker (installed)</li>
<li>xfce: Xfce (installed)</li>
</ul>

<p>To select an option, just supply it as an argument, for example
</p>
  <pre>
    setxsession wmaker
  </pre>
<p>will set your account up so that the next time you run a desktop
  session, Window Maker will be used. If the chosen desktop option is
  not installed, the command will tell you what needs to be
  installed in order to enable it.
</p>

<p>If you are presented with a console login prompt,
  then type the command
</p>
  <pre>
    startx
  </pre>
<p>to start up a graphical session.
</p>

<p>You can enable a graphical login prompt. Use the <code>su</code>
  command to become root, and enable the slim service
</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/svcadm enable svc:/system/slim:default
</pre>

<p>If the mouse doesn't appear to work, you'll need to ensure that hal
  is enabled (this problem is likely to occur if you add the x11
  packages on top of a minimalist install)
</p>
  <pre>
    /usr/sbin/svcadm enable svc:/system/hal:default
  </pre>

<p>For most purposes, the xfce desktop is recommended.</p>

<h2>VNC</h2>

<p>Tribblix also allows you to run a separate desktop session using
  VNC. This offers a number of advantages over a regular desktop
  session - you can easily test out a new desktop, you can disconnect
  and reconnect to the session, and can connect to a session from a
  remote system.
</p>

<p>Similar to the way that <code>setxsession</code> allows you to
  specify which desktop session to run, the <code>setvncsession</code>
  command will allow you to select which desktop environment or
  window manager will be used for a VNC session. Having specified
  which window manager you wish to use, the command
</p>
<pre>
    vncserver
</pre>
<p>
will create the VNC session and print out the connection details. To
connect to a session, for example <code>tribblix:1</code>,
</p>
<pre>
    vncviewer tribblix:1
</pre>
<p>and to terminate a session
</p>
<pre>
    vncserver -kill tribblix:1
</pre>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>Tribblix provides a basic range of tools for desktop use.</p>
