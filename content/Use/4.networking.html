<h1>&gt; Networking</h1>

<p>Tribblix inherits a functional and flexible networking
  subsystem from illumos.</p>

<p>The traditional <code>ifconfig</code> command will show a lot of
  detail on network interfaces. Its output, however, can be hard to read.
  To make things easier, there are several newer commands, such as
  <code>dladm</code> (for datalinks), <code>ipadm</code> (for IP),
  <code>routeadm</code> (for routing), and <code>flowadm</code> (for
  network flows).</p>

<p>Generally, the intention of Tribblix is that networking configuration
  should be handled automatically by tools such as <code>zap</code> rather
  than having to be performed manually by the administrator or user. For
  example, using zap to create and destroy <a href="6.zones.html">zones</a>
  will set up the appropriate networking for you. It's still useful to
  understand what's available behind the scenes, though.</p>

<p>By default, Tribblix networking uses nwam (NetWork Auto Magic) which
  will work out which network interface to use and run dhcp to get the
  configuration automatically. Most of the time, this will do the right
  thing.</p>

<h2>dladm</h2>

<p>The <code>dladm</code> command operates on datalinks - physical or virtual
network objects. Its coverage is quite extensive, so only the most common
cases are covered here.</p>

<p>To show the physical network interfaces, use:</p>
<pre>
  dladm show-phys
</pre>
<p>for example,</p>
<pre>
LINK         MEDIA                STATE      SPEED  DUPLEX    DEVICE
e1000g0      Ethernet             up         100    full      e1000g0
</pre>
<p>which shows that my system has a single <code>e1000g0</code> network card,
that's up at 100Mbps full-duplex.</p>

<p>To show all datalinks, use:</p>
<pre>
  dladm show-link
</pre>
<p>for example,</p>
<pre>
LINK        CLASS     MTU    STATE    BRIDGE     OVER
e1000g0     phys      1500   up       --         --
vnic1       vnic      1500   up       --         e1000g0
bhyve0      vnic      1500   up       --         e1000g0
</pre>
<p>which shows that, in addition to the <code>e1000g0</code> physical
interface, I have two vnic (virtual interfaces) called <code>vnic1</code>
and <code>bhyve0</code>, which are created atop the <code>e1000g0</code>
interface.</p>

<p>If you build zones using exclusive-ip (the <code>-x</code> flag to
<code>zap create-zone</code>) then vnics will be created automatically
as part of that process.</p>

<h2>ipadm</h2>

<p>While <code>dladm</code> manages network interfaces, <code>ipadm</code>
manages the network addresses and properties on those interfaces.</p>

<p>To see which network interfaces <code>ipadm</code> knows about, use:</p>
<pre>
  ipadm show-if
</pre>
<p>for example,</p>
<pre>
IFNAME     CLASS     STATE    CURRENT      PERSISTENT
lo0        VIRTUAL   ok       -m-v------46 ---
e1000g0    IP        ok       bm--------46 ---
</pre>
<p>which shows that <code>ipadm</code> is handling two IP interfaces,
<code>lo0</code> which is the internal loopback device and the physical
<code>e1000g0</code> interface.</p>

<p>To see configured addresses, use:</p>
<pre>
  ipadm show-addr
</pre>
<p>for example,</p>
<pre>
ADDROBJ           TYPE     STATE        ADDR
lo0/v4            static   ok           127.0.0.1/8
lo0/?             static   ok           127.0.0.1/8
lo0/?             static   ok           127.0.0.1/8
e1000g0/_b        dhcp     ok           192.168.0.63/24
e1000g0/?         static   ok           192.168.0.217/24
e1000g0/?         static   ok           192.168.0.201/24
lo0/v6            static   ok           ::1/128
lo0/?             static   ok           ::1/128
lo0/?             static   ok           ::1/128
e1000g0/_a        addrconf ok           fe80::3617:ebff:fec4:1b42%e1000g0/10
</pre>
<p>As you can see, it's getting quite complicated. The <code>ipadm</code>
command thinks in terms of address objects (the names in the ADDROBJ column)
which are the name of the interface and a label.<p>

<p>It's not quite obvious from the above, but the entries with "?" as the
label are associated with shared-ip networking in zones. Each zone has its
own loopback network, and they always have the same address (127.0.0.1/8 for
IPv4 or ::1/128 for IPv6) so those are duplicated.</p>

<h2>routeadm</h2>

<p>There are two parts to <code>routeadm</code>: IP forwarding is the passing
  of IP packets from one network to another; IP routing is the use of a
  routing protocol to determine routes.</p>

<p>Simply running the <code>routeadm</code> command will show the status
  of the routing system. For example:</p>
<pre>
              Configuration   Current              Current
                     Option   Configuration        System State
---------------------------------------------------------------
               IPv4 routing   enabled              enabled
               IPv6 routing   disabled             disabled
            IPv4 forwarding   disabled             disabled
            IPv6 forwarding   disabled             disabled

           Routing services   "route:default ripng:default"

Routing daemons:

                      STATE   FMRI
                   disabled   svc:/network/routing/ripng:default
                   disabled   svc:/network/routing/legacy-routing:ipv4
                   disabled   svc:/network/routing/legacy-routing:ipv6
                     online   svc:/network/routing/ndp:default
                   disabled   svc:/network/routing/rdisc:default
                     online   svc:/network/routing/route:default
</pre>
<p>One thing to note here is that there are a number of associated
  <a href="4.services.html">SMF services</a>. Generally, it's better to
  use <code>routeadm</code> to set things up and let it turn the
  services it needs on and off rather than manipulating the SMF
  services directly.</p>

<h2>flowadm</h2>

<p>In illumos, it's possible to implement resource controls on a lot of
  things, including network utilization. This is all managed and
  monitored using the <code>flowadm</code> command.</p>

<p>This is an advanced topic that won't be covered in detail here. The
  basic command to see if there are any flows configured is:</p>
<pre>
    flowadm show-flow
</pre>
<p>If nothing is returned, then no flows are configured.</p>
<p>If you wish to associate a flow with a <a href="6.zones.html">zone</a>,
  for example to limit its bandwidth utilization, then the <code>-F</code>
  flag to <code>zap create-zone</code> will automatically create a flow
  with the given properties and associate it with the new zone.</p>
<p>If all you want to do is monitor network usage of a zone, then the
  <code>dlstat</code> command will do that for you, with no need to create a
  flow.</p>
