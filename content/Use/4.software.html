<h1>&gt; Managing Installed Software</h1>

<p>As with many distributions, the software available on Tribblix
  comes as a set of packages. Each package is a discrete piece of
  software, which may be a single application, or a tool, library,
  documentation, or supporting files.</p>

<p>Tribblix does not encourage thinking in terms of individual
  packages. Rather, groups of packages called <em>overlays</em>
  provide a useful and complete level of functionality. It is much
  easier to track a small number of overlays than hundreds or
  thousand of individual packages.</p>

<p>To see which overlays are available, and whether they are installed
  or not, use the <code>zap</code> command to query the list of
  overlays:</p>

<code>
zap list-overlays
</code>

<p>Installation, removal, and updates of packages and overlays
  requires you to be running as root.</p>

<p>New or updated overlays or software packages can be retrieved from
  repositories available on the internet. To make your system aware of
  new or updated software, you need to refresh the catalogs with:</p>

<code>
zap refresh
</code>

<p>To install an overlay:</p>

<code>
zap install-overlay <em>overlay_name</em>
</code>

<p>To remove an overlay:</p>

<code>
zap uninstall-overlay <em>overlay_name</em>
</code>

<p>To update the components of an overlay to their current
  versions:</p>

<code>
zap update-overlay <em>overlay_name</em>
</code>

<p>To update the components of all installed overlays to their current
  versions:</p>

<code>
zap update-overlay -a
</code>
