title: Managing overlays

<h1>&gt; Managing overlays</h1>

<p>There are some assumptions in the build process based on my personal
environment, namely that lots of stuff is present under the directory
<code>/packages/localsrc/Tribblix</code> which I have as an environment
variable <code>THOME</code>. You'll need <code>THOME</code> set for much
of the following to work.</p>

<h2>Initial setup</h2>

<p>You'll need to check out one or more of the 3 overlay sources.</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/overlays
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/overlays.lx
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/overlays.sparc
</pre>
<p>You'll also need the build repo, because some of the shared scripts are
supplied there (rather than each set of overlays having a duplicate copy).</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/build
</pre>

<h2>Differences between the repos</h2>

<p>In general, the intention is that the overlays available for the different
variants should be as similar as possible.</p>

<h3>lx vs vanilla</h3>

<p>The lx version is slightly different, only because OmniTribblix has a
couple of extra features. The only differences should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The base overlay for lx includes inotify and the lx zone brand</li>
<li>The lx variant has the azure-baseline and hyperv overlays</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, though, the application overlays for lx should be identical
to the vanilla version. The actual packages are shared between the variants,
so there's no reason for any differences.</p>

<h3>x86 vs sparc</h3>

<p>The sparc version can be quite different. There are significant differences
in the packages that come from illumos - the packages are named differently
in some cases, and there's a different set of drivers. And in terms of
applications, software availability on sparc is quite a bit worse (there's
no go or rust, for example, so anything requiring those won't exist on
sparc at all).</p>

<p>Some of the overlays make no sense at all on sparc (for example, anything
related to cloud).</p>

<p>Related to software availability, some packages for sparc are downrev
compared to x86. (In many cases a later version has been rewritten in rust,
for example, which means we can't update.) That also means that the list
of dependencies can be quite different.</p>

<h2>How the overlays work</h2>

<p>There are 2 files for each overlay. The <code>ovl</code> file is metadata,
and the <code>pkgs</code> file is simply the list of constituent packages.</p>

<p>Generally, I try to normalise the overlays a bit. In other words,
overlays are layered, so you don't have to duplicate packages between
overlays too much. That's more of an aspiration than a hard rule.
Dependencies between overlays are expressed as a <code>REQUIRES</code> entry
in the <code>ovl</code> file.</p>

<p>Adding a new overlay requires creating both files.</p>

<p>Adding new software is simple a case of adding the package to the
<code>pkgs</code> file and bumpoing the version in the <code>ovl</code>
file.</p>

<p>The overlays should be consistent (see the next section for checks),
although there are missing dependencies in some of the core packages. This
is deliberate (for example, perl is missing from the live image which makes
it slightly wrong, but that's a known case and handled correctly).</p>

<h2>Validation</h2>

<p>The validation scripts are shared and come from the build repo.</p>

<p>To check the dependencies are consistent:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}/overlays
../build/overlay-depends -a
</pre>

<p>If there's something missing you can see why for a given overlay:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}/overlays
../build/overlay-depends -v develop-extras
</pre>

<p>You can also check that all the packages actually exist:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}/overlays
../build/check-overlay-pkgs -a
</pre>

<p>Note that a lot of this assumes that you have a copy of the illumos
packages as <a href="9.building_2illumos.html">built earlier</a> to
check against.</p>
