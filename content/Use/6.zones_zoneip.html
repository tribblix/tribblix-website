title: Zone IP address changes
---
<h1>&gt; Zone IP address changes</h1>

<p>If the network configuration of a host changes, then you may have to
change the IP addresses of your zones. For example, I changed my broadband
provider at home, and the old ISP router used the 192.168.0 network, while
the new router used the 192.168.1 network.</p>

<p>In this case, if you're using DHCP (explicitly or automatically via NWAM
which is the default) the change will be picked up automatically. But the
zone configuration will have the old IP addresses embedded and those need to
be updated.</p>

<p>The examples below are appropriate for a network change from 192.168.0
to 192.168.1.</p>

<h2>Shared-ip zones</h2>

<p>For a shared-ip zone, you just need to change the address for each zone.
Having found the old address (via <code>ifconfig</code> for example, run the
command</p>
<pre>
zonecfg -z illumos-build
</pre>
<p>and then update the address</p>
<pre>
select net address=192.168.0.211/24
set address=192.168.1.211/24
end
verify
commit
exit
</pre>
<p>Then you'll need to get the zone to use the new address by rebooting it:</p>
<pre>
zoneadm -z illumos-build reboot
</pre>

<h2>Exclusive-ip zones</h2>

<p>For an exclusive-ip zone (and all LX or bhyve zones will be exclusive-ip)
the parameters in the zone configuration are slightly different, you need
to identify the name of the virtual interface (vnic) that's in use. Then run
the command</p>
<pre>
zonecfg -z alpine1
</pre>
<p>and then update the address</p>
<pre>
select net physical=znic0
set allowed-address=192.168.1.239/24
set defrouter=192.168.1.1
end
verify
commit
exit
</pre>
<p>Then you'll need to get the zone to use the new address by rebooting it:</p>
<pre>
zoneadm -z alpine1 reboot
</pre>

<p>You may then need to get whatever's inside the zone to pick up the changes,
if it's been statically configured.
For example, with an LX zone running alpine you'll need to log in to the
console via VNC and run setup-interfaces.</p>

<h2>All zones</h2>

<p>There's one additional step needed for all zones, as zap saves the
network configuration for its own use. This can be fixed by updating the
relevant <code>zconfig</code> files stored in <code>/var/zap/zones</code>:</p>
<pre>
cd /var/zap/zones
sed -i s:192.168.0:192.168.1: zconfig.*
</pre>
