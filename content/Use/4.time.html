title: Keeping good time

<h1>&gt; Keeping good time</h1>

<p>It's helpful to have your system keep the correct time. It's obviously
useful to know what the time is, but certain functionality won't work well
or at all if the computer's notion of time is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Entries in log files which show times will be far less useful</li>
<li>Encrypted connections can rely on system clocks being synchronized</li>
</ul>

<p>Tribblix can correct the system time with a high degree of accuracy
using NTP - the Network Time Protocol - which compares your clock with
a number of reference clocks on the internet. The implementation used in
Tribblix is called <code>chrony</code>.</p>

<p>In recent releases, chrony is installed by default. If it isn't, then
install it using:</p>
<pre>
zap install TRIBchrony
</pre>

<p>To check if it's running, use the command:</p>
<pre>
svcs -p chrony
</pre>

<p>If it's not online, then enable it using:</p>
<pre>
svcadm enable svc:/network/chrony:default
</pre>

<p>If the system has been running without time synchronization, then the
clock may have drifted. This will slowly be corrected. To see what the
current state is, use the <code>chronyc tracking</code> command. This will
give a variety of information, which will include something like:</p>
<pre>
# chronyc tracking
...
System time     : 14.466815948 seconds fast of NTP time
</pre>
<p>The above shows that the clock is off by almost 15 seconds. After a few
minutes this should come down to close to zero, and <code>chrony</code>
should be able to hold the time accurate to within a few milliseconds.</p>
