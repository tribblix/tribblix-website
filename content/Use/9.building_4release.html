title: Building release packages

<h1>&gt; Building release packages</h1>

<p>There's a small but important package repository - the release
repository.</p>

<p>This repository ships 3 packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>TRIBrelease-name</li>
<li>TRIBzap</li>
<li>TRIBzap-upgrade</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, TRIBzap supplies most of the <code>zap</code> package management
and systems administration tools.</p>

<p>The TRIBrelease-name package just supplies the <code>/etc/release</code>
and <code>/etc/os-release</code> files, which contain the main identifiers
of exactly which version of Tribblix is installed.</p>

<p>The TRIBzap-upgrade package supplies the list of upgrade candidates and
the upgrade script. The reason for shipping the upgrade script in this
package is so that it can be updated to match new upgrade candidates.</p>

<p>Within the lifetime of a given release, only the upgrade package will
ever get updated. And it gets updated whenever the next release becomes
available. Initially, therefore, the upgrade list is essentially empty
(technically, it contains itself).</p>

<p>There are some assumptions in the build process based on my personal
environment, namely that lots of stuff is present under the directory
<code>/packages/localsrc/Tribblix</code> which I have as an environment
variable <code>THOME</code>. You'll need <code>THOME</code> set for much
of the following to work.</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>There are 2 source code repositories of interest that you'll need
to check out:</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/tribblix-release
</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/zap
</pre>
<p>plus you'll also need the <code>tribblix-build</code> repo if you haven't
checked it out already,</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/tribblix-build
</pre>

<h2>Creating packages</h2>

<p>There are several parts to this. First we need to add the information for
a new release to the <code>tribblix-release</code> repo. For example, to add
<code>m36</code> as a successor to <code>m35</code>, for both normal Tribblix
and OmniTribblix:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}/tribblix-release
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -c m35
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -v lx -c m35
</pre>
<p>What this will do is add a directory for each release with the appropriate
metadata files in it.</p>

<p>Next create the driver maps for ddu. This requires you to have
<a href="9.building_2illumos.html">built the gate</a> already, as it
needs a source for the driver mapping. This makes assumptions about
naming and locations.</p>
<pre>
./mk-driver-map.sh -V m36
./mk-driver-map.sh -V m36lx
</pre>

<p>Then you can create the packages. There are actually 4 upgrade
pathways here: m35 to m36, m35lx to m36lx, and then the cross-upgrades
m35 to m36lx and m35lx to m36.</p>
<pre>
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -u m35
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -v lx -u m35
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -u m35lx
./mk_pkgs.sh -p i386 -r m36 -v lx -u m35lx
</pre>

<p>This will drop the packages into <code>/tmp/pct</code>, and also populate
per-release directories in <code>../release-repos</code>.</p>

<p>For publication on the online repo, a catalog files is needed.</p>
<pre>
./gen_catalog.sh ../release-repos/m36.i386 > ../release-repos/m36.i386/catalog
./gen_catalog.sh ../release-repos/m36lx.i386 > ../release-repos/m36lx.i386/catalog
</pre>

<p>What the above will also have done is create the upgrade packages
for the <code>m35</code> and <code>m35lx</code> releases, again in the
per-release directory in <code>../release-repos</code>. Those will need
new catalogs as well:</p>
<pre>
./gen_catalog.sh ../release-repos/m35.i386 >! ../release-repos/m35.i386/catalog
./gen_catalog.sh ../release-repos/m35lx.i386 >! ../release-repos/m35lx.i386/catalog
</pre>
