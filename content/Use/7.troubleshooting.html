<h1>&gt; Monitoring and Troubleshooting</h1>

<p>When looking at a system, the questions you might ask might fall
  into several categories.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What have I got?</li>
  <li>What is it doing?</li>
  <li>What's wrong?</li>
  <li>How do I fix it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What have I got?</h2>

<p>It helps to have a good understanding of what you're looking at
  before you start. And I'm just talking about the basics - how much
  memory, how many of what type of CPUs, disk, network, and, at a
  high level, how it's structured, along with a rough understanding
  of what types of tasks the system is performing.</p>

<h3>CPU</h3>

<p>To get a listing of the CPUs present in your system, the command is</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/psrinfo -vp
</pre>
<p>which will tell you how many CPUs you have, how many cores and
  threads each one has, and the model details of each CPU.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get the total memory is</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/prtconf -m
</pre>
<p>which gives the total memory in megabytes. (This might be a few
  megabytes smaller than the marketing capacity, as the system can
  reserve memory.)</p>

<p>You can see details of which memory slots are occupied in the
  output from</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/prtdiag
</pre>
<p>although the output can be erratic. Even more details of the
  components can be found by looking through the output
  of <code>/usr/sbin/smbios</code>. Optionally,
  the <code>memconf</code> tool may be installed, which can parse
  these information sources into more easily understood forms.</p>

<p>A partner to memory is swap space, you can get a summary with</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/swap -sh
</pre>
<p>
and a list of swap devices and their usage with
</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/swap -lh
</pre>

<h3>Disk</h3>

<p>There are a couple of ways to get information on the installed disk
  (storage) devices.</p>

<p>If you're root, the easiest way is to type</p>
<pre>
    diskinfo
</pre>
<p>and you'll get a list, with the properties of each disk.</p>

<p>If you're not root, then</p>
<pre>
    iostat -En
</pre>
<p>will give information on all storage devices known to the
  system. The weakness of this method is that the information is a
  little hard to read, and that it will include removable media
  devices, such as CD-ROM drives, whether or not there is media in
  the drive. (In some circumstances it will also report on phantom or
  removed devices, especially if connected to external storage
  arrays.)</p>

<p>There's then the question of what the disk devices are used
  for. With illumos, it's most likely to be ZFS. You can see the
  available zfs pools</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/zpool list
</pre>
<p>
and their status, and how they're constructed from the available
disk devices
</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/zpool status
</pre>
<p>
You can also see how the storage pool is split up into file systems using
</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/zfs list
</pre>
<p>
Generally, if you have problems, <code>zpool status</code> will tell you about
hardware failures, while <code>zpool list</code> will give utilization - it's
important to keep usage of a ZFS pool below about 90% capacity, as performance
can decline sharply above that point.
</p>

<h3>Network</h3>

<p>The simplest and most traditional way to see the state of the
  network is to use</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/ifconfig
</pre>
<p>(traditionally, <code>ifconfig</code> on its own produced a usage
  message, but now the default output is the same as that given by
  the <code>-a</code> flag).</p>

<p>The two other tools available are <code>dladm</code>
  and <code>ipadm</code>, for working with network interfaces and
  configuring IP on those interfaces respectively.</p>

<p>Running these commands without arguments produces a usage
  message. To see what's going on, there are a variety of show-
  subcommands that are available. For example</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/dladm show-phys
    /usr/sbin/dladm show-aggr
    /usr/sbin/dladm show-vnic
    /usr/sbin/dladm show-etherstub
    /usr/sbin/dladm show-wifi
</pre>
<p>will show physical interfaces, aggregations (LACP), virtual NICs,
  virtual networks, and wifi interfaces. There are more objects that
  can be shown. Usually, if the system has none of the appropriate
  objects, nothing will be output. At the IP level, you'll probably
  want to start with
</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/ipadm show-if
    /usr/sbin/ipadm show-addr
</pre>

<p>To see how the system will route traffic, use</p>
<pre>
    netstat -nr
</pre>
<p>which will print the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables.</p>

<h3>Zones</h3>

<p>You should also see what, if any, zones are present</p>
<pre>
    /usr/sbin/zoneadm list -icv
</pre>
<p>The important point here is that certain resources (Networking, ZFS
  datasets) may be delegated to zones, so those resources may not be
  fully visible in the global zone. Also, the workloads running in
  zones need to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Of course, one fundamental question is whether you're actually
  looking at a non-global zone. The <code>zonename</code> command will
  output the string "global" if you're in the global zone, or the name
  of the zone if you're in a non-global zone.</p>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>A general view of what's actually running can be given by</p>
<pre>
    top
</pre>
<p>
which will list the running processes and how much memory and CPU
each is using. For an alternative view, try <code>htop</code>.
</p>

<p>
While the load average isn't a terribly accurate measure of the load
on a system, a load average in excess of the number of CPUs in the system
likely indicates that the system is overloaded.
