title: Router Zones

<h1>&gt; Router Zones</h1>

<p>In illumos, you can create a separate internal network - an etherstub -
and can create network interfaces attached to that network.</p>

<p>A router zone provides a mechanism to connect that internal network to
the outside world and manage systems attached to that internal network.</p>

<p>To create a router zone:
</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -t router -z zrouter10 \
-x 192.168.0.226 \
-R 10.10.10.0/24
</pre>
<p>This creates a custom zone called <code>zrouter10</code>, with external
address <code>192.168.0.226</code>.</p>

<p>An internal network (technically, an etherstub) will be created to go
with this zone. The subnet <code>10.10.10.0/24</code> will be configured.
The router zone will have the bottom address on this subnet (in this case,
that will be <code>10.10.10.1</code>) and will be configured to NAT all
traffic from that subnet.</p>

<p>The router zone will also have a dhcp server that can be used to
manage systems attached to the configured subnet.</p>

<p>You can create other zones as normal. If you specify an IP address for a
new zone that's on the configured subnet, then it will be connected to that
subnet and the router zone will route the traffic for it.</p>

<p>So, for example, creating a bhyve zone like so:
</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -t bhyve -z bhyve10 \
  -x 10.10.10.10  \
  -I /var/tmp/tribblix-0m37.iso \
  -V 8G
</pre>
<p>Will connect the new zone to the subnet. The dhcp server on the router
zone will be configured to give out the right details.</p>

<p>Native illumos zones (ie, sparse-root, whole-root, and alien-root)
will work the same way if you set them up as exclusive-ip (ie, with the
<code>-x</code> flag).</p>

<p>You can set up a shared-ip zone (with the <code>-i</code> flag) but such
zones won't be able to communicate outside the subnet. (The reason here is
that the network interface associated with a shared-ip address belongs to
the global zone, rather than the router zone, so routing doesn't work.) So,
if you can, set zones up to use exclusive-ip.</p>

<p>While NAT will allow traffic from zones to get out, there's no way
for external traffic to reach one of the zones on the subnet. If you need to
log in via <code>ssh</code>, use the router zone as a jumphost. In the future,
it will be possible to use haproxy in the router zone as a reverse proxy.</p>

<p>There are a few cases where using router zones like this may be useful:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Security - the zones on the internal network can be blocked from external
access</li>
<li>When you don't have enough IP addresses (you can have potentially
hundreds of zones behind a router zone)</li>
<li>As a variant of the previous one, on AWS you might have unlimited
addresses available in your VPC, but any given EC2 instance is limited
to a tiny number of addresses.</li>
</ul>
