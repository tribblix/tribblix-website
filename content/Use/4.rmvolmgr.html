<h1>&gt; Tribblix and Removable Media</h1>

<p>
Removable media - specifically CD-ROMs and USB sticks - can be
automatically mounted on Tribblix.
</p>

<p>
To enable automatic mounting, you need to install <code>rmvolmgr</code>:
</p>
<pre>
zap install-overlay dbus-glib
zap install TRIBsvc-hal TRIBsvc-storage-media-volmgr
svcadm enable hal
</pre>
<p>and then enable it</p>
<pre>
svcadm enable rmvolmgr
</pre>
<p>(If you're running a desktop that includes the <code>x11</code> overlay, then
the packages will already be installed and the service simply needs to be
enabled.)
</p>

<p>
With the <code>rmvolmgr</code> service running, the system will automatically
mount any filesystem it recognises on the removable media under the
<code>/media</code> directory, for example:</p>
<pre>
# ls /media
/media:
NIKON D3200
</pre>

<p>
To remove the media once you've finished with it, first make sure that no
processes are currently accessing the media (including any interactive shells
that may have cd'ed into the filesystem) and then <code>eject</code> it by
using the name of the mounted filesystem:</p>
<pre>
eject /media/NIKON\ D3200
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, running <code>eject -l</code> will print a list of removable
media devices and their nicknames that can also be used as the argument to
the <code>eject</code> command.
