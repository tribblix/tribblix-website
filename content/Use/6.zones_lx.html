title: LX Zones

<h1>&gt; LX Zones</h1>

<p>To run LX zones, you need to be running omnitribblix, not vanilla Tribblix.
If you're not sure, run the <code>uname -v</code> command - omnitribblix
will end in <code>lx</code>.
</p>

<p>A wide range of Linux distributions are supported. The simplest way is to
get Tribblix to download an image for you. For example:
</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -t lx -z fedora \
  -x 192.168.0.238  \
  -I proxmox:fedora
</pre>
<p>
or
</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -t lx -z ubuntu \
  -x 192.168.0.239  \
  -I ubuntu:22.04
</pre>
<p>
In the above, you can download images from a couple of sources -
<code>proxmox</code> and <code>ubuntu</code>. With proxmox, add the name
of the distribution you want, optionally with the version attached. With
ubuntu, add the version as YY.MM, although the code names are also accepted.
</p>

<p>As an alternative, you can simply supply a tarball of a Linux instance
(or an export of a docker image, although it needs to be a full image
with init present).</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -t lx -z myserver \
  -x 192.168.0.240  \
  -I /var/tmp/my-linux-server.tar.gz
</pre>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If the ssh server doesn't start, for example on Ubuntu, you may need to
force regeneration of the host keys"
</p>
<pre>
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
</pre>
