<h1>&gt; Sustainability</h1>

<p>Tribblix takes sustainability and the environment very seriously.</p>

<p>This website, for example, scores very highly on the
<a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">Website Carbon</a> calculator.</p>

<p>The minimalist philosophy means that Tribblix requires less resources
to run - many other systems require more processing power, memory, and
storage.</p>

<p>Tribblix is lean, fast, and efficient. This doesn't just mean that it
works acceptably on low-end systems; Tribblix flies on modern hardware.</p>

<p>Because Tribblix does work well on older systems, you can keep those
older systems running for longer and avoid them becoming e-waste.</p>

<p>That's a good start, there's clearly a lot more opportunity to improve
the sustainability of the applications that come with Tribblix - while
the set of applications available is curated with speed and efficiency in
mind, and unnecessary options turned off, there's a residual footprint
associated with each application that Tribblix does not directly control.</p>
