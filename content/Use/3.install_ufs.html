title: Installation with UFS

<h1>&gt; Installation with UFS</h1>

<p>While Tribblix can be installed using the legacy UFS file system rather
than ZFS, this is not recommended. You will be unable to use zones, it
will be impossible to upgrade to a newer release, and it will stop working
entirely in 2038.</p>

<p>The advantage is that UFS requires less memory than ZFS. In particular,
if your system has less than 1GB of memory installation to ZFS will run
slowly or fail to run at all.</p>

<h2>UFS partitioning</h2>

<p>You have to <a href="3.install_partition.html">partition</a> the disk
by hand before starting the installation.</p>

<p>The installer requires that 2 slices exist, <code>s0</code> for the
root file system and <code>s1</code> for swap.</p>

<p>If you have a blank disk then create a <code>solaris2</code> partition
using fdisk:</p>
<pre>
fdisk -B /dev/rdsk/cXtYdZp0
</pre>

<p>Run format and choose the disk you're using. Type 'p' to go into the
partition (slice) menu, and 'p' to show the partitions. Enter a number to
edit that slice.</p>

<p>First type '1' to edit slice 1, type 'swap' for the
tag, accept the permissions, the starting cylinder should be 0, and then
input the size, given that you're most likely to be using a UFS installation
because the system is short of memory anything from 512mb to 2gb should
be plenty.</p>

<p>Then type 'p' again to make sure it looks OK and take a note of the last
cylinder for slice 1 and slice 2.</p>

<p>Then type '0' to edit slice 0, type 'root' for the
tag, accept the permissions, the starting cylinder should be 1 more than
the end cylinder of slice 1, and then when it asks for the size enter the
last cylinder for slice 2 with an <code>e</code> appended.</p>

<p>Then type 'p' again to make sure it looks OK. Then 'l' to label the disk
following which you can exit format.</p>

<h2>Installation process</h2>

<p>Once the disk has been partitioned, then run the UFS installer like so:</p>
<pre>
./ufs_install.sh cXtYdZs0 [overlays...]
</pre>
<p>Note that the installation will always use slice zero.</p>

<p>The majority of the options to the normal installer don't apply to
a UFS installation at all. The only options that are accepted are
<code>-n</code> to set the system name and <code>-t</code> to set the
timezone.</p>

<h2>Using EFI partitioning</h2>

<p>Tribblix is flexible enough that installing with UFS to a disk with a
GPT label on it is possible, but it requires

more work</a>.</p>
