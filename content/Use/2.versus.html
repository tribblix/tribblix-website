<h1>&gt; Comparison with Similar Distributions</h1>

<p>It may be worth considering some of the differences between Tribblix and
  the other members of the Solaris/illumos family. None of the following
  should be considered criticism - it is simply true that different
  distributions have made different choices.</p>

<p>There are a number of core similarities - all distributions in the family
support ZFS, Zones, Dtrace, and SMF.</p>

<h2>Solaris 10</h2>

<p>In some ways, Tribblix is a much modernised descendant of Solaris 10. Like
Solaris 10, Tribblix uses SVR4 packaging. However, there is no equivalent of
Solaris patches - updates are supplied as complete replacement packages.</p>

<p>Zone support in Tribblix is also similar to Solaris 10, with sparse
and whole root. Tribblix adds more flexible installation of whole root
zones (partial root). Mind you, zone installation in Tribblix is far quicker
than it ever was in Solaris 10. Unlike Solaris 10, however, packaging in the
global zone doesn't know how to automatically manage and update packages in
zones.</p>

<p>A key feature missing in Solaris 10 that is available in Tribblix and all
the other distributions considered here is crossbow, or virtualized networking.
</p>

<h2>Solaris 11</h2>

<p>Solaris 11 is entirely different to Tribblix. It uses IPS for packaging
instead of SVR4, has no support for sparse root zones, and has dropped
support for whole swathes of older hardware.</p>

<h2>OpenIndiana</h2>

<p>OpenIndiana is similar to Solaris 11, as both are direct descendants of
the OpenSolaris distribution, using IPS for packaging instead
of SVR4, and sharing much of the logic for building 3rd-party packages with
Solaris.</p>

<p>Compared to Tribblix, OpenIndiana has chosen MATE rather than XFCE as the
default desktop. In terms of secondary desktops, Tribblix has a wide
choice, but OpenIndiana has very little - but probably has a more thoroughly
integrated version of its default desktop than Tribblix does.</p>

<p>OpenIndiana has a pretty good Xorg stack and better graphics card support
than Tribblix. (Tribblix is limited here because I really don't have access
to any interesting graphics cards at all.)</p>

<p>It's often said that OpenIndiana uses a rolling release model, but that's
not entirely true. OpenIndiana is continually updated, but can't roll a
release at an arbitrary point. Tribblix only updates the illumos pieces
when a release is made, but is a true rolling release in that a release can
be made at an arbitrary point.</p>

<h2>OmniOS</h2>

<p>The primary focus of OmniOS is servers. Out of the box, there's simply
no desktop support there at all. That's a deliberate feature. If you want
a minimalist base to build your own stuff on top of (the KYSTY principle)
then that's OmniOS - although you can take the minimal Tribblix install and
use it exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Unlike OpenIndiana and Tribblix, OmniOS isn't built from vanilla illumos
but their own variant, which has LX zones amongst other things. (The
omnitribblix variant is based on the same source as OmniOS.) Aside from that,
other features might show up in OmniOS before other distributions.</p>

<p>If you want LX zones on Tribblix, install and use the OmniTribblix
variant.</p>

<h2>SmartOS</h2>

<p>SmartOS is special-purpose, aimed at being a pure hypervisor. If
you wanted to build a private cloud, while other illumos distributions such
as Tribblix will help you build one yourself, SmartOS along with Triton and
Manta is designed to build it for you.</p>
