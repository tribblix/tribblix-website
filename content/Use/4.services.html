<h1>&gt; Services and SMF</h1>

<p>In Tribblix, all running services are controlled by SMF, the Service
  Management Facility. There are two key commands. The first is:</p>
<pre>
  svcs
</pre>
<p>which lists the services and their status.</p>

<p>If you add the <code>-a</code> flag, then all services will be shown (by
  default, disabled services will be ignored). If you add the <code>-p</code>
  flag, then the running processes associated with each service will be listed.
  </p>

<p>Not all services have long-running processes associated with them. Many
  just run something the once (often at boot).</p>

<p>Normally, you would expect to see a long list of services that are
  <em>online</em>. Those are the active services. You may see a handful
  listed as <em>legacy_run</em> - SMF still supports the old init system
  that ran scripts from the <code>/etc/rc*.d</code> directories. These
  services aren't tracked. Any service in <em>maintenance</em> is broken,
  indicating a problem.</p>

<p>The first thing to do when investigating a problem with a service is
  to ask SMF to explain what's wrong, using:</p>
<pre>
  svcs -xv
</pre>
<p>The next thing is to check the logs associated with a service. These are
  normally found in <code>/var/svc/log</code>, but you can ask SMF where the
  log for a given service. For example, the name of the log file for the zones
  service would be shown by:</p>
<pre>
  svcs -L zones
</pre>
<p>You may also have log files associated with the application, but if an
  application is really broken it may not be able to write to its own logs.
  In that case it might write a helpful error to <code>stdout</code> or
  <code>stderr</code>, which will end up in the SMF logs.</p>

<p>You'll see that the services have a long name. This is called an FMRI
  (Fault Managed Resource Identifier). Generally, you don't need the full
  name, as the last unique element will suffice. The last part of the name,
  after the colon (<code>:</code>) is an instance. In most cases there's only
  the one copy of a service, the <code>default</code>) instance, but some
  services have multiple instances which can be controlled independently.</p>

<p>The other command you need is <code>svcadm</code>. For example, if you
  had nginx installed, then you could enable nginx with:</p>
<pre>
  svcadm enable nginx
</pre>
<p>Or disable it with:</p>
<pre>
  svcadm disable nginx
</pre>
<p>If you need to restart it, you can either run disable and enable, or
  simply:</p>
<pre>
  svcadm restart nginx
</pre>
<p>Imagine that nginx wasn't working, and ended up in the <em>maintenance</em>
  state. Once you've diagnosed and fixed the problem, you need to let SMF know
  that everything should be OK and it should try the service again:</p>
<pre>
  svcadm clear nginx
</pre>
