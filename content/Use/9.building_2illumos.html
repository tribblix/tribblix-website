title: Building illumos-gate

<h1>&gt; Building illumos-gate</h1>

<p>The packages from illumos-gate form the foundation of Tribblix. How
they're built is described below.</p>

<p>There are some assumptions in the build process based on my personal
environment, namely that lots of stuff is present under the directory
<code>/packages/localsrc/Tribblix</code> which I have as an environment
variable <code>THOME</code>. You'll need <code>THOME</code> set for much
of the following to work.</p>

<h2>Initial setup</h2>

<p>What you'll also need is a copy of the <code>tribblix-build</code> repo,
which contains the build scripts and other files for the build.</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/tribblix-build
</pre>

<p>At the very end you'll need a copy of the <code>build</code> repo,
which contains the online repo management scripts.</p>
<pre>
cd $THOME
git clone https://github.com/tribblix/build
</pre>

<p>You'll also need a signing key. In Tribblix, the ELF objects are signed
(as in the <code>-S</code> flag for the package generation scripts below).
To create one:</p>
<pre>
mkdir ${HOME}/f
cd ${HOME}/f
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -subj "/O=MyName/CN=myname.org" \
  -keyout elfcert.key -out elfcert.crt -days 3650
chmod 644 elfcert.key
</pre>
<p>For verification, a copy of the <code>.crt</code> file needs to end up in
the <code>/etc/crypto/certs</code> directory. With that, you can use
<code>elfsign verify</code> to verify a given file.</p>

<p>The distribution packages (the zap files) themselves are also signed;
that will be covered elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Creating a build host</h2>

<p>The canonical way to build illumos in Tribblix is to use a specially
configured zone. This makes sure that the global zone doesn't get corrupted
by the changes necessary to set up the build environment.</p>

<p>The zone will need the develop, java17, python312, and illumos-build
overlays installed. To create it use a command such as the following:</p>
<pre>
zap create-zone -z illumos-build -t whole -i 192.168.1.201 \
-o develop -o java17 -o python312 -O illumos-build \
-S /export/packages/localsrc -U ptribble
</pre>
<p>Breaking this down, the <code>-z</code> flag defines the name of the zone,
the <code>-i</code> flag sets up the IP address, the <code>-o</code> flags
copy those overlays from the global zone and the <code>-O</code> flag
installs the build environment in the zone. If some of the overlays aren't
installed in the global zone then you can either install them there or use
the <code>-O</code> flag instead.</p>

<p>The <code>-S</code> flag shares the named directory with the zone, and
the <code>-P</code> flag copies the named user.</p>

<p>Once the zone is installed there are a few minor changes that are
necessary.</p>
<pre>
pfexec zlogin illumos-build
rm /usr/bin/cpp
cd /usr/bin ; ln -s ../gnu/bin/xgettext gxgettext
cd / ; ln -s export/packages .
</pre>

<h2>Setting up the build</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll need is a copy of the illumos source. The way I do
this is to have a reference copy of the gate on my machine, and build clones
of that, rather than having to pull it over the network every time I do a
build. If you want to build OmniTribblix then you'll need the source for
the OmniOS variant of illumos-gate as well.</p>
<pre>
mkdir ${HOME}/Illumos-reference
cd ${HOME}/Illumos-reference
git clone https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate
git clone https://github.com/omniosorg/illumos-omnios
</pre>
<p>Once you have these, simply <code>git pull</code> as necessary to keep
them up to date.</p>

<p>You'll also need the closed components. Tribblix has minimized the use
of non-open components, but you still need the whole set for the build.
Assuming you're going to do you build in an <code>Illumos</code> directory,
then get a copy of the closed binaries like so:</p>
<pre>
mkdir ${HOME}/Illumos
cd ${HOME}/Illumos
wget -c \
  http://www.tribblix.org/illumos-build/on-closed-bins.i386.tar.bz2 \
  http://www.tribblix.org/illumos-build/on-closed-bins-nd.i386.tar.bz2
</pre>
<p>You don't need to unpack them now; the build process will handle that.</p>

<h2>Building the gate</h2>

<p>The first step is to check out a copy of illumos that you can build.
Let's assume you're going to build something called m37-gate.</p>
<pre>
cd ${HOME}/Illumos
rm -fr m37-gate
git clone ${HOME}/Illumos-reference/illumos-gate m37-gate
</pre>

<p>For OmniTribblix it's slightly trickier, there's a bit of a hack to
remove a dependency on ncurses. Note also that the name of the OmniTribblix
repo here has to match the name above with "lx" in the middle (the build
looks for the corresponding vanilla copy of the gate).</p>
<pre>
cd ${HOME}/Illumos
rm -fr m37lx-gate
git clone ${HOME}/Illumos-reference/illumos-omnios m37lx-gate
cd m37lx-gate
git format-patch --stdout -1 3cb7d45669f9143c833d58e902f8880804a51791 &gt; 1.patch
sed -i s:Makefile.tools:Makefile:g 1.patch 
git format-patch --stdout -1 6b8791159f33fb8479bb3c5a19e624dff6ed35bf &gt; 2.patch
gpatch -R -p1 &lt; 1.patch
gpatch -R -p1 &lt; 2.patch
rm 1.patch 2.patch
cd ..
</pre>

<p>Then all you have to do is log in to the illumos-build zone and
run the build.</p>
<pre>
zap zssh illumos-build

cd ${HOME}/Illumos/m37-gate
${THOME}/tribblix-build/illumos/releasebuild m37
</pre>

<p>For OmniTribblix it's:</p>
<pre>
zap zssh illumos-build

cd ${HOME}/Illumos/m37lx-gate
${THOME}/tribblix-build/illumos/omnibuild m37lx
</pre>

<p>You don't need to use m37, of course. If you do it like this then you'll
get a build of the current code with the m37 name attached to it. All that's
required is that there's an <code>illumos.sh</code> env file in the
<code>${THOME}/tribblix-build/illumos</code> directory with a suffix equal
to the name you choose, so you can create a distribution with whatever name
you like. It's probably best to start from the most recent env file there,
as it will be the closest to having the right properties for the current
state of Tribblix and illumos.</p>

<h2>Adding gfx-drm</h2>

<p>The other component that we need from illumos is the <code>gfx-drm</code>
packages. These can be built with a single script.</p>
<pre>
cd ${HOME}/Illumos
rm -fr gfx-drm
${THOME}/tribblix-build/gfx-drm/gfx-drm.sh -V 0.37
</pre>
<p>The version given here, 0.37, matches m37. This will build both the
vanilla and omnitribblix packages. (They're the same, they just have different
version numbers to match what packaging expects.)</p>

<h2>Creating packages</h2>

<p>Assuming the build is successful, you can create packages from the
builds.</p>

<p>You need to be root in the global zone for this step. (You can't use
$THOME or $HOME here as root is a different account.)</p>
<pre>
/packages/localsrc/Tribblix/tribblix-build/repo_all.sh \
  -G /export/home/ptribble/Illumos/m37-gate \
  -V "0.37" \
  -D /var/tmp/m37-pkgs \
  -S /export/home/ptribble/f/elfcert >& /var/tmp/m37.log
</pre>

<p>Or for OmniTribblix, it's:</p>
<pre>
/packages/localsrc/Tribblix/tribblix-build/repo_all.sh \
  -G /export/home/ptribble/Illumos/m37lx-gate \
  -V "0.37lx" \
  -D /var/tmp/m37lx-pkgs \
  -S /export/home/ptribble/f/elfcert >& /var/tmp/m37lx.log
</pre>

<p>Those take a while. One they're done I copy them to my local
distribution area, as yourself in the global zone:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}
mkdir -p illumos-pkgs-m37/pkgs/
cp /var/tmp/m37-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap illumos-pkgs-m37/pkgs/
cp /var/tmp/m37-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap.md5 illumos-pkgs-m37/pkgs/
</pre>
<p>and for OmniTribblix</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}
mkdir -p illumos-pkgs-m37lx/pkgs/
cp /var/tmp/m37lx-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap illumos-pkgs-m37lx/pkgs/
cp /var/tmp/m37lx-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap.md5 illumos-pkgs-m37lx/pkgs/
</pre>

<p>You also need to copy the gfx-drm packages into the same place.
Remember this was done in the illumos-build zone, and that we shared
$THOME with the zone when we created it.</p>
<pre>
zap zssh illumos-build
cd ${THOME}
cp /var/tmp/gfx-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap* illumos-pkgs-m37/pkgs/
cp /var/tmp/omni-gfx-pkgs/pkgs/*.zap* illumos-pkgs-m37lx/pkgs/
</pre>

<p>Then the metadata (catalog) needs to be created, again as yourself in the
global zone:</p>
<pre>
cd ${THOME}/build
./create-illumos-files ../illumos-pkgs-m37/pkgs
./create-illumos-files ../illumos-pkgs-m37lx/pkgs
</pre>
