<h1>&gt; Tribblix Virtualization and zones</h1>

<p>A zone is a virtualized system that gives the
  illusion of being an independent system while sharing resources with
  its host.</p>

<p>For most purposes, particularly from an application-centric point
  of view, you can think of a zone as a separate system. It has
  its own file systems, networking, users, applications, and
  services. System-centric resources are shared. There is only a
  single kernel running, shared by all zones, and hardware and
  resource administration is done once.</p>

<p>As a contrast, hypervisors such as VMware, Xen, and KVM emulate a
  physical system, and each virtualized system using these
  technologies contains a full operating system. Not only is this
  inefficient in that each system has to be allocated enough resources
  to run a full standalone operating system, it is inefficient in that
  the systems have to be managed as full and independent operating
  system instances.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, Docker presents an isolated custom
  environment customized for a specific environment. It isn't
  providing a complete system, as normal system services are missing,
  and Docker provides no native support for storage or networking.</p>

<h2>Types of zones</h2>

<p>A note on nomenclature: the underlying system is referred to as
  the <em>global zone</em>, other zones are
  <em>non-global zones</em>.
</p>

<p>Tribblix supports a number of zone variants.</p>

<h3>Sparse-root</h3>

<p>A sparse-root zone in Tribblix is very similar to the sparse-root
  zones available in Solaris 10. In such a zone, the operating system
  binaries (the file systems such as /usr) are mounted read-only from
  the global zone. The zone has its own copies of configuration files
  (such as /etc) and can have its own private file systems.</p>

<h3>Whole-root</h3>

<p>The other zone type available in Solaris 10 is also available in
  Tribblix. A whole-root zone has its own writable copy of the
  operating system, initially set up as a clone of the global zone
  (so it will initially have the same software installed, although
  this can be changed later).</p>

<h3>Alternate-root</h3>

<p>An alternate-root zone is just like a sparse-root zone, but where
  the operating system binaries are mounted read-only not from the
  global zone, but from an alternate source. You can use the
  <code>create-zone-template</code> zap subcommand to build such an
  alternate image, allowing you to build sparse-root
  zones that have a specific set of packages installed, rather than
  simply inheriting whatever the global zone happens to have. (This
  also makes the sparse-root zone unaffected by changes to the global
  zone.)</p>

<h3>Partial-root</h3>

<p>Tribblix allows an extended variant of a whole-root zone, in which
  the installed software can differ from the global
  zone. Specifically, you can specify that a subset of the overlays
  present in the global zone be present in the non-global zone, and
  that additional overlays can be added at zone creation time.</p>

<h3>Alien-root</h3>

<p>Tribblix allows you to create a zone from another illumos
  distribution. Specifically, it knows how to create a zone from the
  installation ISO images for some of the distributions. This feature
  is experimental, as there is no guarantee that the system software
  provided by another distribution is compatible with that in
  Tribblix.</p>

<p>This facility also allows you to create a zone running a prior
  version of Tribblix.</p>

<p>The alien-root variant allows you to install a zone from any
  tarball, so you can construct arbitrary zone images (the mvi project
  is one way to do this) for specific purposes. In particular, very
  minimalist single-application zones can be built.</p>

<h3>bhyve</h3>

<p>The byhve hypervisor allows you to run a virtual machine, within which you
  can run a range of alternative operating systems. While it's possible
  to run bhyve standalone, illumos distributions including Tribblix will
  normally wrap a bhyve instance inside a zone, to allow an additional
  layer of management.</p>

<h3>LX</h3>

<p>If you're running the omnitribblix variant, then the LX (Linux
  Emulation) brand is available. With this, you can run many Linux
  distributions and applications in a zone.</p>

<p><a href="6.zones_lx.html">More on LX...</a></p>

<h3>Blank zones</h3>

<p>Not strictly a zone variant, zones in Tribblix can be configured to
  boot as a blank system - one with no services (other than the
  necessary init process) running. To run applications, you must use
  zlogin to enter the zone and start any applications you require.</p>

<h3>solaris10</h3>

<p>You can run an old Solaris 10 image as a zone. This is useful if
  you have an old system you wish to import, or if you still need to
  build applications compatible with Solaris 10. (To create such an
  image from distribution media, pkgadd the required packages to an
  alternate root with <code>-R</code>, and tar that image up.)</p>

<h2>Creating zones</h2>

<p>Zones are created using the create-zone subcommand to zap. In the
  simplest case;
</p>
<pre>
    zap create-zone -z myzone
</pre>
<p>
  will create a sparse-root zone called <em>myzone</em>, without any
  networking. The <code>-z</code> flag is the only mandatory thing you
  must supply. The other options are listed below.
</p>

<h3>-t whole|sparse|alien|s10|lx|bhyve</h3>

<p>You can specify the zone variant to use with the -t flag. The
  default is to create a sparse-root zone. If creating an alien-root,
  s10, or lx zone, you will need to also supply the <code>-I</code>
  flag to tell the system where the image you're going to use is to be
  found.</p>

<p>The lx zones are only available on omnitribblix.</p>

<p>For s10 (solaris10) zones, the TRIBsys-zones-brand-s10 package must
  be installed.</p>

<p>For bhyve zones, the bhyve overlay must be installed.</p>

<h3>-T template</h3>

<p>Allows you to create a sparse-root zone from a template. Use
  the <code>create-zone-template</code> zap subcommand to create the
  template zone in the first place.</p>

<h3>-i ip_address</h3>

<p>Create the zone with the given IP address. This creates a virtual
  interface on a shared physical interface. This flag can be specified
  more than once to allocate multiple IP addresses to the zone. In the
  shared network stack model, addresses are manually assigned from the
  global zone and cannot be manipulated in the non-global zone.</p>

<h3>-x ip_address</h3>

<p>Creates a network device exclusively for the zone's use. It is the
  responsibility of the zone to actually do all the network
  configuration required.</p>

<p>There's a subtle difference between the <code>-i</code>
  and <code>-x</code> options. With <code>-i</code>, the zone will be
  booted with the given IP address. With <code>-x</code>, it is free to
  use any IP address it chooses, although the system will only allow the
  specified address to work. Thus, with <code>-x</code>, you'll either
  have to configure the IP address manually, or use cloud-init with bhyve.
</p>

<h3>-o overlay</h3>

<p>For a whole-root zone, only copy the given overlay (or overlays, if
  multiple <code>-o</code> flags are given) to the newly created
  zone. The new zone will thus have the appropriate subset of packages
  installed.</p>

<p>If the global zone does not have the specified overlay installed,
  it will not be installed in the newly created zone either. Use
  the <code>-o</code> flag strictly to install a subset.</p>

<p>With the <code>-o</code> flag, the software is simply copied from
  the global zone. No package installation is done, and no attempt
  will be made to retrieve a package from a networked repository.</p>

<h3>-O overlay</h3>

<p>For a whole-root zone, add the specified overlay (or overlays, if
  multiple <code>-O</code> flags are given) to the newly created
  zone.</p>

<p>With the <code>-O</code> flag, software packages will be installed
  afresh, being retrieved from either a network repository or the
  global zone's cache.</p>

<h3>-U user</h3>

<p>Allocate the zone to the given user (or users, if
  multiple <code>-U</code> flags are given). Specifically, the user
  will exist in the zone with the same username and password as the
  global zone; the user's home directory will be shared with the
  global zone (so when you log in to the zone, all your files will be
  there); and the user has administrative rights to the zone - in
  particular, they will be able to use <code>zlogin</code> to log in
  to the zone both as themselves and as root.</p>

<h3>-d extra_dir</h3>

<p>Creates a ZFS file system and mounts it at the given location in
  the zone. The data will be accessible from the global zone and will
  persist even if the zone is destroyed.</p>

<h3>-D dataset</h3>

<p>Creates a ZFS dataset and delegates it to the zone. The data will
  not be accessible from the global zone, will be under the management
  of the zone, but will persist even if the zone is destroyed.</p>

<h3>-I image</h3>

<p>Specifies the location of an image file to be used when creating a
  zone.</p>
<p>For alien-root zones, this can be an installation ISO, a
  tarball, or a zfs send stream in a file.</p>
<p>For lx zones, this should be a tarball or a logical name.</p>
<p>This can be an absolute path to a file, if local, or a logical
  image name that will be downloaded as required. Some examples of
  logical image names are omnios:r151042, proxmox:alpine, and
  ubuntu:22.04.</p>

<h3>-S|-s shared_dir</h3>

<p>Specifies a directory (that must exist) that will be shared with
  the zone. It will be mounted at the same location in the zone as in
  the global zone. With <code>-S</code>, the directory will be mounted
  read-write; with <code>-s</code>, it will be read-only.</p>
 
<h3>-B</h3>

<p>Specifies that the zone will boot up blank, with no processes
  (besides the necessary init) running. You will have
  to <code>zlogin</code> to the zone to run anything.</p>

<p>If you want networking in a blank zone, use the <code>-i</code>
  flag to specify an address. In a blank zone, the normal network
  configuration commands will never run, but IP addresses specified
  with the <code>-i</code> flag are configured by the global zone and
  will still work.</p>
