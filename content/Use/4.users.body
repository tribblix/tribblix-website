<h1>&gt; Managing Users</h1>

<p>Adding a new user to the system is as simple as</p>

<code>
  zap create-user myname
</code>

<p>The only required argument is the username of the new user. If you
want to customize the properties of the account then you can use the
following arguments, which are similar to the same arguments of
  the <code>useradd</code> command:</p>

<ul>
  <li>-c "a comment" : a description of the account</li>
  <li>-d /directory/name : the home directory for the user, by default
    this will be a directory named after the username in
    <code>/export/home</code></li>
  <li>-g group : you can specify the name (or numeric id) of an
  existing group that the new account should belong to</li>
  <li>-u uid : you can specify the numeric user-id of the new account</li>
  <li>-s shell : you can specify the login shell of the new user,
    <code>/usr/bin/bash</code> will be used if unspecified </li>
</ul>
<p>A full example might be:</p>
<code>
  zap create-user -c "Smell tester" -d /var/smell -u 456 -s /bin/zsh smell
</code>

<p>Once you've created a user account, you'll need to set a passwd,
  with the command</p>
<code>
  passwd myname
</code>
<p>If the account is being accessed remotely over ssh, it's better to
  set up the <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file to allow login
  using their ssh key, in which case you should remove the password
  from the account so that only the ssh key grants access, with</p>
<code>
  passwd -N myname
</code>

<p>To delete a user account:</p>
<code>
  zap delete-user myname
</code>
<p>If you want the user's home directory to be deleted as well, then
  use the <code>-r</code> flag, like so:</p>
<code>
  zap delete-user -r myname
</code>

<h2>/home vs /export/home</h2>

<p>On Tribblix, user home directories are created under
<code>/export/home</code>. This is a good place for them, and for normal
users (as opposed to accounts for running services) there's no need to
change it.</p>

<p>The <code>/home</code> directory might also be used. However, that
location is often managed by the automounter, so you can't create a
directory there. There are extra steps to configure the automounter,
and it would normally only make sense for a network of systems where
home directories are shared with NFS.</p>
