<h1>&gt; Upgrading Tribblix</h1>

<p>From time to time, a new version of Tribblix will be made
  available. This will update to a more recent build of illumos, and
  will also update applications to match.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to <a href="3.update.html">keep Tribblix
  up to date</a>. If you're fully up to date (<code>zap
  refresh</code> and <code>zap update-overlay -a</code>) then you
  can check for available upgrades with:</p>

<code>
zap upgrade list
</code>

<p>This will return one or more lines of output, showing the current
version and any other versions available for upgrade. For example:</p>

<pre>
m37: (current)
</pre>

<p>Shows you that you're currently running the m37 release, and there
  are no upgrades available. If it says:</p>

<pre>
m37: (current)
m38: Tribblix m38
</pre>

<p>Then that's an indication that there's a new version - in this
  case <em>m38</em> - available that you can upgrade to. You don't
  have to upgrade, but it's often a good idea as updates to older
  versions will stop fairly quickly once a new release has been made.</p>

<p>What you might also see in the above output is that there may be
  multiple newer versions available to you. There's also a minor
  distinction between update releases within a stream, and going to a
  new version.
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An update release - such as m36.1 - shares the application
    updates with all the other update releases in that stream. In
    other words, from the point of view of applications, running an
    <a href="3.update.html">update</a> will give you exactly the same
    application versions as an upgrade.</li>
    <li>A full release - such as m38 - will have a different set of
    application updates. In particular, it may introduce completely
    new applications, and application updates that are incompatible
    will tend to occur at a full release boundary. In fact, it's the
    need to make incompatible changes that drives full releases as
    opposed to update releases, as a full release can establish a new
    baseline of application versions.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Once a new full release has been made, application updates for the
  old release will stop relatively quickly (although application
  updates for security issues may continue a while longer), and the
  focus will shift to only updating applications for the new release.
</p>

<p>You can upgrade directly to any release listed. You don't have to
  go through any intermediate releases.</p>

<p>To actually perform the upgrade, run the following command, with
  the version you want to upgrade to:</p>

<code>
  zap upgrade m38
</code>

<p>This will take a few minutes. It will create a clone of your
  current system, and update all the software on that clone to the
  correct version. Once it's done, you'll see a message similar to the
  following:</p>

<pre>
=====================================================
|| To switch to the newly upgraded version, issue  ||
|| the following commands:                         ||
||   beadm activate m38                            ||
||   init 6                                        ||
=====================================================
</pre>

<p>If you're happy, then issue the two commands shown, and the system
  will reboot, and you'll be running the newly upgraded version of
  Tribblix.</p>

<h2>Managing multiple versions</h2>

<p>Once you've upgraded, the old version of Tribblix is still
  present. In illumos, you can have multiple <em>boot
  environments</em>. The upgrade process clones the running system to
  a new boot environment, and upgrades that rather than attempting to
  upgrade the running system in place, which is much safer.</p>

<p>You can see which boot environments are present on your system with
  the command:</p>

<code>
  beadm list
</code>

<p>which will return something similar to the following:</p>

<pre>
BE    Active  Mountpoint  Space   Policy  Created
m37   -       -           38.73M  static  2025-07-14 14:24
m38   NR      /           22.73G  static  2025-11-10 13:34
</pre>

<p>Here I have 2 boot environments. The current one is
  called <code>m38</code> - the <code>NR</code> in the Active column
  shows that it's being used now ("N") and will be used if the system
  reboots ("R"). I also have an older boot
  environment, <code>m37</code>, so you can see
  the upgrade path.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you want to use one of the older boot
  environments (for example, you've upgraded and something doesn't
  quite work correctly), then you need to activate it:</p>

<code>
  beadm activate m37
</code>

<p>and then reboot.</p>

<p>You can also list and select boot environments from the boot loader
  screen.</p>

<p>Old boot environments do take up space - they are, after all, a
  copy of the operating system. Once you're sure that you won't need
  to go back, you can delete them. For example:</p>

<code>
  beadm destroy m37
</code>
