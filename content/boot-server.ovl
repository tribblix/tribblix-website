<h1>Overlay boot-server - Boot/install server</h1>
<p>In the past, this overlay provided the ability to set up a network boot
server so that you could boot and install Tribblix over the network. It needs
to be replaced with something that works with loader rather than grub, so
you should not be using it at the present time.</p>
