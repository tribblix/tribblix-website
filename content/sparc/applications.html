<h1>&gt; applications on SPARC</h1>

<p>I though it worthwhile to put together some notes on the current
  problems pertaining to the state of applications on SPARC,
  specifically illumos. These are generic across illumos distributions
  although informed by my experience maintaining applications on
  Tribblix.</p>

<p>(On Tribblix, the aim generally is that if I can build an
  application easily on SPARC then it will be packaged, and at the
  same version as on x86 if I can. The aim is to avoid unnecessary
  divergence and make it easier to fill gaps later.)</p>

<h2>Desktop</h2>

<p>Quite a lot of desktop applications work on SPARC. On Tribblix,
  I've ignored enlightenment and Qt as environments, and don't build
  Pale Moon or LibreOffice. But all the old window managers work, as
  do the base desktops like Xfce and MATE.</p>

<p>Actually using a desktop is trickier, as running an X server
  locally is problematic due to issues around drivers for graphics
  cards. But pointing a working X server to an xdm session on the
  SPARC system works pretty well.</p>

<h2>Go</h2>

<p>There is no go port for SPARC. This largely removes the entire
  ecosystem of modern go applications at a stroke.</p>

<p>Yes, there's gccgo. That is really quite old (in terms of go
  versions, it's always behind), and is just the compiler not the
  entire ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Node</h2>

<p>There's no port of Node.JS to SPARC, largely because there's no
  port of the V8 javascript runtime on which it's based.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>

<p>Support for SPARC was removed from OpenJDK upstream at the same
  time support for Solaris was removed. At the present time, I have
  builds of JDK17 for SPARC on both illumos and Solaris 11.4 available
  <a href="https://pkgs.tribblix.org/openjdk/">for download</a>. This
  is good enough to run the Jenkins agent. The port has reached JDK18
  and early builds of JDK19; whether it will go much further (because
  of virtual threads) remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Rust</h2>

<p>Currently we don't have rust. Making it work doesn't seem to be an
  insurmountable problem, as it is available as a cross-compile target
  and Solaris 11 has it. Apart from the direct impact of blocking
  applications written in Rust, there's also a number of Python
  modules that can't be build because they use Rust, or depend on some
  other module that needs Rust.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<p>By and large, Python works. There are issues with module
  availability due to the Rust requirement, and some Python scripts
  seem to run abnormally slowly on SPARC.</p>

<h2>Haskell</h2>

<p>I don't currently have Haskell (ghc) available on SPARC. I do have
  an older bootstrap so it may be possible to get something more
  current working.</p>
