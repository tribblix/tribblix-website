<h1>&gt; illumos on SPARC</h1>

<p>The following is a record of <a href="./">SPARC</a> systems that
  are known to work, or known to not work, with illumos. Be aware that
  there may be subtle differences in configuration or firmware that
  may lead to alternate results.</p>

<p>Working graphics cards are few and far between. There have been no
  recent reports of successfully using the local graphics cards to run
  an X session.</p>

<p>A reasonable memory configuration is a minimum of 1G. While it's
  possible to install Tribblix in 768M, that's the lower limit with
  the current builds.</p>

<p>Reports regarding success or otherwise on other models are
  welcome, please let us know on the
  <a href="https://illumos.topicbox.com/groups/sparc">mailing
  list</a></p>

<h2>Known to work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>T4-1, T4-2</li>
  <li>T5240/T5140</li>
  <li>T5120/T5220</li>
  <li>T1000/T2000</li>
  <li>SunBlade 2000</li>
  <li>SunBlade 1500</li>
  <li>SunBlade 150</li>
  <li>SunFire V240</li>
  <li>SunFire V120</li>
  <li>Sun Netra X1</li>
  <li>E450</li>
  <li>Ultra 5</li>
  <li>Ultra 2</li>
  <li>Ultra 1 (not the 140MHz one, though)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that using the IDE controllers on some of the newer
  entry-level desktops can be problematic.</p>

<p>On the sun4v systems, installation on either bare metal or inside
  an LDOM is supported. There is as yet no support for running as a
  control domain (ie, for hosting other LDOMs).</p>

<h2>Should work, but don't</h2>

<p>The following systems should be supported, but do not currently
  work. There's a suspicion that gcc builds here are faulty, and old
  Studio builds work.</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>M-series (Olympus, M3000/M4000/M5000)</li>
  <li>T5440 (if fully populated)</li>
  <li>T4-4 (if fully populated)</li>
  <li>T3-2 (if fully populated)</li>
  <li>Ultra 25/45</li>
</ul>

<h2>Will not work</h2>

<p>The following systems will not work, as there is no support in the
  codebase for them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit systems (sun4m, sun4d, sun4c,...)</li>
  <li>T5, T7, M7/M8</li>
  <li>Enterprise servers (E3000/E3500-E6000/E6500)</li>
  <li>StarFire/StarCat (E10K, F15K, F25K)</li>
  <li>Telco (CT) systems</li>
</ul>
