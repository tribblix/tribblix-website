<h1>Overlay pkgsrc - Pkgsrc bootstrap</h1>
<p>Supplies the <a href="https://pkgsrc.smartos.org/install-on-illumos/">pkgsrc
bootstrap.</p>

<p>As an alternative, you could install the bootstrap kit manually. The
package is simply a convenience.</p>

<p>Generally, mixing applications from Tribblix and applications from
pkgsrc doesn't work well. If you're going to use pkgsrc, it's best to
rely on it exclusively.</p>
