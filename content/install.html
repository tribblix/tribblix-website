<h1>&gt; Installation</h1>

<p>The below are appropriate for current Tribblix on x86; there are
separate <a href="install-sparc.html">installation on SPARC instructions</a>,
and you can <a href="cloud.html">run in the cloud directly</a>.
</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the ISO image, you can boot an emulator
such as VirtualBox directly from the ISO. For physical hardware, you
can use cdrecord or cdrw to burn the image to a DVD.</p>

<p>For VirtualBox, set the graphics driver to VMSVGA in the VirtualBox
setup.</p>

<p>Booting from the DVD should take a few minutes or less, and you
should be presented with a login prompt.</p>
<pre>
tribblix login:
</pre>
<p>The username is jack, the password is jack.</p>

<p>You can now log in and investigate. The environment here is
deliberately minimalist.</p>

<p>You can install to hard disk. To do this you will have to become root</p>
<pre>
# su - root
</pre>
<p>where the password is "tribblix". Then run the format command</p>
<pre>
# format
</pre>
<p>which will give you a list of disks. (If you want to see removable devices
as well, use <code>format -e</code>.)</p>

<p>In the simplest case, where you just have one disk and want to use
it all for Tribblix, just run the live_install.sh script with the name
of the desired disk, like so:</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -G c1t0d0
</pre>

<p>You can also install additional software packages at this
point. Additional package sets are known as overlays, so you don't need
to know anything about individual packages. There's
a <a href="overlays.html">complete list</a>, but here are some of the
overlays likely to be commonly used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>wifi - wifi drivers, add this if you plan to use wifi</li>
<li>x11 - enough for a basic X11 installation</li>
<li>desktop - an Xfce-based desktop with common tools</li>
<li>server - a basic server installation without applications</li>
<li>develop - development tools and headers</li>
<li>java - openjdk17</li>
<li>kitchen-sink - combined desktop, server, and development</li>
</ul>
<p>
and you simply add the name of the overlay(s) you want to install to
the install command, like so:</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -G c1t0d0 develop desktop
</pre>
<p>Any required overlays will be installed automatically. There's a
special overlay, called <b>kitchen-sink</b> that will install most
things, and that's what I often use.</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -G c1t0d0 kitchen-sink
</pre>
<p>You can add additional software overlays later using
the <a href="zap.html">zap</a> utility.
</p>

<p>Then reboot</p>
<pre>
reboot -p
</pre>
<p>If it boots off the DVD, then hit 6 to ChainLoad the hard disk.
This should then boot up.</p>

<p>When booted up the first time, you have the same user account (jack)
and same user and root passwords as the live image, which you should
immediately change.</p>

<h2><a name="efi"></a>EFI partitioning</h2>

<p>The install script will use the traditional partitioning method for
laying out the disk - creating a Solaris partition that spans the whole
device. If you use the -G flag instead of the older -B, then it will create a
whole disk pool with an EFI System partition instead, to support booting
with UEFI firmware. I recommend always using -G rather than -B.</p>

<h2><a name="manual"></a>Manual partitioning</h2>

<p>The default installation above will use the whole disk for Tribblix
and all the available space for the root file system. If you want to do
something different, then you can manually partition the
disk. Ultimately, you'll need to create a Solaris fdisk partition, and
then tell the installer to use a given slice in that partition,
omitting the -B or -G flag.</p>

<p>If you just have one disk and want to use it all for Tribblix, use
fdisk -B to delete all the current partitions and just have a single
Solaris partition. You should use the disk name followed
by <code>p0</code>, for example</p>
<pre>
# fdisk -B /dev/rdsk/c1t0d0p0
</pre>

<p>If you already have partitions, and you wish to save some of them,
then simply create a Solaris partition in some free space.</p>

<p>Now run format again and choose the disk you're using. Type 'p' to
go into the partition (slice) menu, and 'p' to show the
partitions. What you need to do is make slice 0 be almost the whole
disk. Type '0' to edit slice 0, type 'root' for the tag, accept the
permissions, the starting cylinder should be 1 (the aim is to avoid
slice 8, which should just be using cylinder 0) and then the size
should be the end cylinder (which should be the same as that of slice 2
which you should be able to see) with an 'e' on the end. Then type 'p'
again to make sure it looks OK. Then 'l' to label the disk and exit
format.</p>

<p>That's the complex bit. To actually install, run the installer with
slice 0 of your chosen disk as the argument. If the disk is
<code>c1t0d0</code>, then you're installing to <code>c1t0d0s0</code>
</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh c1t0d0s0
</pre>
<p>(optionally followed by the names of overlays you want to install) and
wait a few minutes for it to do the install.</p>

<h2><a name="mirror"></a>Installing to a mirrored pool</h2>

<p>If you have 2 identical drives, you can create a mirrored ZFS pool
that will give you redundancy against disk failure (and allow ZFS to
heal any data corruption). Use the <code>-m</code> flag to specify
the second disk:</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -G -m c1t1d0 c1t0d0
</pre>

<h2><a name="mirror"></a>Installing to a raidz pool</h2>

<p>If you're installing m25.1 or later, it's possible to use a raidz pool
for the system. Care needs to be taken that all the disks in the raidz pool
are visible to the BIOS. Use the <code>-z</code> flag for raidz1, and
<code>-Z</code> for raidz2, and specify
the list of disks in quotes, for example:</p>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -G -z "c1t0d0 c1t1d0 c2t0d0 c2t1d0"
</pre>

<h2><a name="overlay"></a>Installing to an existing ZFS pool</h2>

<p>If you wish to install Tribblix to an existing pool (for example, you
have an older Tribblix release, a corrupted install, or an alternative
illumos distribution already installed, and you don't want to lose the data)
then there's a script to do just that. It works just like the regular
installer but with a different name, and takes the name of the existing pool
as the destination rather than a disk device:</p>
<pre>
# ./over_install.sh -B rpool list_of_overlays...
</pre>
<p>This mechanism will give you a fresh install, although it will copy the
system ssh keys and user account details from the existing system to make
it easier to log in and get going. Using the <code>-N</code> flag will
prevent this information from being copied across.
</p>

<h2><a name="ipxe"></a>Installation using iPXE</h2>

<p>Some cloud providers allow you to install using iPXE, or you can boot
iPXE media from <a href="https://ipxe.org/">ipxe.org</a> and get an
interactive iPXE shell.</p>

<p>For a cloud provider, you simply need to tell it where the ipxe
configuration script is. An example is given in the article
<a href="https://ptribble.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/installing-tribblix-on-vultr-using-ipxe.html">Installing Tribblix on Vultr using iPXE</a>.</p>

<p>Or, if you're booting from an <a href="https://ipxe.org/">ipxe.org</a>
image, once you have networking set up you can chain the configuration script.
You can get a menu by chaining the following script:</p>

</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can go directly to one of the entries in the following
list, depending on which version you want to boot.</p>
