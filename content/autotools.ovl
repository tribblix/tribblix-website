<h1>Overlay autotools - The GNU autotools</h1>
<p>Supplies the autotools, for software development.</p>

<p>You usually don't need this to build 3rd-party software, and having
it installed (especially libtool) causes problems for some applications,
which is why it's separated out from the @develop overlay.</p>
