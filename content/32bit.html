title: 32-bit support

<h1>&gt; 32-bit support</h1>

<p>
As of February 2018, support for 32-bit x86 hardware was removed
from illumos. This only affects the kernel; 32-bit applications are still
supported.
</p>

<p>
The last Tribblix version to support 32-bit hardware in any meaningful
sense was the 0m20 release. This was unsupported, was many years out
of date with no updates or security fixes, and has been completely
retired as of early 2025.
