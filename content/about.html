<h1>&gt; About</h1>

<p>Tribblix is an operating system distribution derived from
OpenSolaris, <a href="https://openindiana.org/">OpenIndiana</a>, and <a
href="https://www.illumos.org/">illumos</a>, with a retro style and
modern components. The base kernel and commands come
from illumos, with everything else rebuilt from scratch.</p>

<p>Tribblix is a traditional system. Software is distributed as
SVR4 packages, lightweight window managers are preferred over heavy
desktop environments, the primary desktop option is <a
href="https://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a>, and
<a href="https://mate-desktop.org/">MATE</a> and
<a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment</a> are also
available, plus many others. The system is flexible, fast, and
familiar to those who've used Solaris in the past, while shipping
modern software on the solid foundation it's based on.</p>

<p>Tribblix isn't just a spin or repackaging of another illumos
distribution. It's a completely independent distribution that, while
sharing the key illumos technologies such as ZFS, zones, DTrace, and
SMF, has been essentially built from scratch, with its own build and
packaging system.</p>

<p>A version for <a href="/sparc/">SPARC</a> is also available. Due to
limited availability of hardware both for myself and the illumos
community as a whole, hardware support might be limited. This was
bootstrapped with <a href="https://archiveos.org/opensxce/">OpenSXCE</a>, and
doesn't yet have the full range of packages that are available for x86
systems.</p>

<p>What's in the name? It may seem rather vain, but if I were
to choose a name from scratch I wouldn't have come up with this and
would probably have gone for some obscure solar-powered
pun. However, at one of the OpenSolaris summits we took part in a Go
Game, and one of the questions was:</p>

<p>Which of the following is not an OpenSolaris-derived distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schillix</li>
<li>Tribblix</li>
<li>Belenix</li>
<li>OpenSolaris 2009.06</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure that whoever set the question knew how close that was
to the name of someone on the project, but that was how the name became
planted in my consciousness.</p>
