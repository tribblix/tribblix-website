<h1>Changes in 0m1 prerelease</h1>
<p>
Added TRIBsys-lib-iconv-utf-8 to the base
</p><p>
Moved xsvc from the base to the x11 overlay
</p><p>
Moved xz, p7zip from the base to the develop overlay
</p><p>
Added TRIBsys-lib-math-header-math, TRIBlib-perl-5-xml-parser, zsh,
cdrtools, xslt, pbzip2, emacs, and prerequisites to the develop overlay
</p><p>
Added volmgr, cdrw to retro-desktop overlay
</p><p>
Rebuilt AfterStep 2.2.11; it and prerequisites added to retro-desktop
overlay
</p><p>
Created all-locales overlay
</p><p>
Updated version to 0.1
</p><p>
Update the scripts in TRIBsys-install-media-internal; no longer need
solarismisc.zlib; don't lofs mount /jack and /root
</p><p>
Updated the gnome desktop caches to reflect the current build and
locations
</p><p>
Trim /usr on the ramdisk; found something based on the joyent list that
will work
</p><p>
The live_install.sh script unpacks packages in /tmp, not /var/tmp,
allowing the ramdisk to be quite a bit smaller
</p><p>
Don't copy /sbin, /kernel, /lib to the iso - they're already in the
ramdisk so don't need to be duplicated.
</p><p>
Correctly set up /dev; some directories were missing.
</p><p>
Rebuilt glib and pixman; now use my versions rather than importing from
OI. Everything built above them is freshly built, but glib and pixman
were essential to HAL and Xorg.
</p><p>
Xfce initial build - essentially works, but new users can't save the
panel configuration
</p><p>
Add cmake to develop overlay
</p><p>
Added a selection of xfce panel plugins
</p><p>
Add gpicview
</p>
