<h1>&gt; Installation (SPARC)</h1>

<p>The below are appropriate for Tribblix on SPARC; there are
separate <a href="install.html">installation on x86 instructions</a>.
</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the ISO image, you
can use cdrecord or cdrw to burn the image to a DVD.</p>

<p>Booting from the DVD should take a few minutes or less, and you
should be presented with a login prompt.
<pre>
tribblix login:
</pre>
The username is jack, the password is jack.</p>

<p>You can now log in and investigate. The environment here is
deliberately minimalist.</p>

<p>You can install to hard disk. To do this you will have to become root
<pre>
# su - root
</pre>
where the password is "tribblix". Then run the format command
<pre>
# format
</pre>
which will give you a list of disks.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, where you just have one disk and want to use
it all for Tribblix, just run the live_install.sh script with the name
of the desired disk, like so:
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -B c1t0d0
</pre></p>

<p>You can also install additional software packages at this
point. Additional package sets are known as overlays, so you don't need
to know anything about individual packages. There's
a <a href="overlays.html">complete list</a>, but here are some of the
overlays likely to be commonly used on SPARC:
<ul>
<li>x11 - enough for a basic X11 installation</li>
<li>retro-desktop - additional window managers, tools, and libraries</li>
<li>develop - development tools and headers</li>
<li>networked-system - packages to integrate a system into a network,
such as NIS, LDAP, NFS</li>
<li>java - openjdk8</li>
<li>kitchen-sink - a desktop and development tools</li>
</ul>
and you simply add the name of the overlay(s) you want to install to
the install command, like so:
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -B c1t0d0 develop
</pre>
Any required overlays will be installed automatically. There's a
special overlay, called <b>kitchen-sink</b> that will install most
things, and that's what I personally use.
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh -B c1t0d0 kitchen-sink
</pre>
You can add additional software overlays later using
the <a href="zap.html">zap</a> utility.
</p>

<p>Then reboot
<pre>
reboot -p
</pre>
If it boots off the DVD, then hit 6 to ChainLoad the hard disk.
This should then boot up.</p>

<p>When booted up the first time, you have the same user account (jack)
and same user and root passwords as the live image, which you should
immediately change.</p>

<h2><a name="manual"></a>Manual partitioning</h2>

<p>The default installation above will use the whole disk for Tribblix
and all the available space for the root file system. If you want to do
something different, then you can manually partition the disk, and
then tell the installer to use a given slice in that partition,
omitting the -B flag. Manual partitioning is only for experts; if
you're not familiar with the way Solaris disk partitions/slices
work, use the defaults.</p>

<p>Run format and choose the disk you're using. Type 'p' to go into the
partition (slice) menu, and 'p' to show the partitions. Enter a number to
edit that slice, for example type '0' to edit slice 0, type 'root' for the
tag, accept the permissions, the starting cylinder should be 0, and then
input the size. (The overall size is that of slice 2
which you should be able to see.) Then type 'p'
again to make sure it looks OK. Then 'l' to label the disk and exit
format.</p>

<p>That's the complex bit. To actually install, run the installer with
slice 0 of your chosen disk as the argument. If the disk is
<code>c1t0d0</code>, then you're installing to <code>c1t0d0s0</code>
<pre>
# ./live_install.sh c1t0d0s0
</pre>
(optionally followed by the names of overlays you want to install) and
wait a few minutes for it to do the install.</p>

<h2><a name="overlay"></a>Installing to an existing ZFS pool</h2>

<p>If you wish to install Tribblix to an existing pool (for example, you
have an older Tribblix release, a corrupted install, or an alternative
illumos distribution already installed, and you don't want to lose the data)
then there's a script to do just that. It works just like the regular
installer but with a different name, and takes the name of the existing pool
as the destination rather than a disk device:
<pre>
# ./over_install.sh -B rpool list_of_overlays...
</pre>
This mechanism will give you a fresh install, although it will copy the
system ssh keys and user account details from the existing system to make
it easier to log in and get going. Using the <code>-N</code> flag will
prevent this information from being copied across.
</p>
